lab4 folder contains the following files:
Makefile
README
charType.c
in

I added the in as a test file for you if you wish to test my code using it, the in file
is the one provided on the class website for lab4

In order to run the executable file, I use the following command:
./charType in out

I add the check target in the make file, it uses the source file charType.c as input 
and outputs the report to a file named charTypeOut, the output file is deleted if you
do a make clean command

Let me know if you have any other questions!
