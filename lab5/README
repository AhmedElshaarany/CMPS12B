lab5 folder contains the following files:
Dictionary.c
Dictionary.h
DictionaryClient.c
DictionaryTest.c
Makefile
MakefileTest
README

I added the MakefileTest to make it easier for you to 'make' for the DictionaryTest.c

In order to run the executable file, I use the following command on my Mac:
./DictionaryClient

I added the check target for valgrind in both makefiles

Let me know if you have any other questions!
